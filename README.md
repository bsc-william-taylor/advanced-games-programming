# Advanced Games Programming

The Advanced Games Programming module taught advanced programming concepts in C++, Graphics, Networking and Multithreading.
 
## Assignment

The assignment was in two parts. Part one was to implement an advanced topic and then create a lab as if you were teaching it to someone else. Part two was to take a much more advanced topic and implement it.

## Submission

For part one I decided to implement peer to peer networking using UDP networking in a cross platform application. For the example I decided to write a Pong application that could be played on multiple PCs through UDP. The lab was a simple UDP example

* IP / UDP / TCP
* Networking Libraries
* Linux vs Windows

Part two was a graphical demonstration which implemented many advanced features including the following:

* Deferred Rendering
* HeightMap Generation
* Cube Maps
* Light Volumes
