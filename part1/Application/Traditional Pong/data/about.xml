Traditional Pong is exactly what it says it is. It is the original pong with a few alterations. I created this not to create an amazing new pong but to try cross platform development and also develop my programming skills. Of course if you have any bugs you would like fixed message me at the email below. Please make sure to message me if you have any ideas you would like implemented as well.
